      <p>Case Study: Designing Beyond the Screen Reimagining DeepMay.net & Advocating for Ethical Design in a Campfire Talk</p>

      <p>Introduction</p>

      <p>The intersection of design, technology, and ethics is a battleground where designers wield the power to shape experiences. Inspired by the philosophy of designing less but better, this case study explores the redesign of DeepMay.net through a lens that prioritizes minimalism, accessibility, and ethical usability. In parallel, it structures a campfire talk aimed at young designers, challenging them to rethink their role in combating environmentally harmful corporate tech initiatives.</p>

      <p>> "Good design is as little design as possible." > — Dieter Rams</p>

      <p>In an era where screen addiction, data exploitation, and digital waste are normalized, how can designers push back? How can they create meaningful, sustainable experiences that don’t just feed into big tech’s hunger for attention? The answer may lie in no-interface thinking, ethical coding, and an alternative approach to digital experiences—one that embraces slowness, imperfection, and even analog solutions.</p>

      <p>---------- Phase 1: The DeepMay.net Redesign</p>

      <p>Current Challenges</p>

      <p>1. Interface Clutter – Too many visual elements distract from the core purpose of the site. 2. Performance & Sustainability – Unoptimized assets and inefficient code lead to higher energy consumption. 3. Navigation Issues – A lack of intuitive flow makes it difficult for users to find relevant information. 4. Over-Reliance on Traditional UI Design – A standard web experience may not align with the deeper, more reflective purpose of DeepMay.</p>

      <p>Redesign Approach 1. No-Interface Thinking: Reducing UI to Amplify UX</p>

      <p>- Removing unnecessary interactions – Prioritizing direct content access over complex UI components. - Reducing screen dependency – Encouraging real-world engagement through offline resources. - Simplifying user flow – Information architecture that reduces the number of clicks needed to reach critical content. > "Technology should be an extension of the human body and mind, not a replacement." > — Jony Ive</p>

      <p>2. Sustainable Front-End Development</p>

      <p>- Static-First Approach – Using lightweight HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript for optimal speed and low energy use. - Dark Mode Default – Lowering screen energy consumption by emphasizing dark backgrounds and high-contrast text. - Progressive Enhancement – Ensuring core functionality works even when JavaScript is disabled. - No Third-Party Trackers or Heavy Analytics – Reducing unnecessary data collection that fuels ad-driven economies. > "Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials." > — Dieter Rams</p>

      <p>3. Brutalist & Accessible Aesthetic</p>

      <p>- High-contrast, typography-led design for enhanced readability and focus. - Grid-based structure reducing decorative elements in favor of raw, functional layouts. - No pop-ups, no excessive animations to limit distractions and reduce cognitive load.</p>

      <p>By shifting towards a brutalist, information-first design approach, DeepMay.net embraces the idea that form follows function—where function isn’t just usability, but ethical sustainability as well. Key Website Improvements Implemented</p>

      <p>1. Offline-First Content  - Users can download select articles as plain-text PDFs or print-friendly formats, eliminating unnecessary screen time. 2. Hyper-Minimalist Navigation  - No mega-menus, sidebars, or hidden navigation bars—just direct, intuitive paths to information. 3. Encouraging Slower Consumption  - Instead of algorithmically suggesting more content, the site actively encourages pause and reflection through typography and layout choices. 4. No Algorithmic Personalization  - Every visitor sees the same, equal experience without data collection or tracking. 5. Lightweight, Future-Proof Code  - The site is built with vanilla HTML and CSS, ensuring longevity without dependencies on bloated frameworks. 6. Local-First, No Cloud Reliance  - Instead of cloud-heavy integrations, the site runs with minimal server requests, reducing environmental impact. ---------- Phase 2: Structuring the Campfire Talk</p>

      <p>Title: “Design as Resistance” A conversation on the privilege and obligation to use design for environmental justice. Key Themes</p>

      <p>1. The Invisible Costs of Design  - How modern UI/UX decisions contribute to server energy consumption.  - The role of endless scrolling and algorithmic engagement in increasing carbon footprints. 2. The Responsibility of a Designer  - Moving beyond aesthetic choices to consider the broader ethical impact.  - Real-world case studies of companies leveraging design for or against sustainability. 3. No-Interface & Low-Interface Design Principles  - Examples of tech that prioritizes minimal interactions.  - How designing with less screen time in mind can be an act of resistance. 4. Call to Action: Implementing Change in Your Own Work  - Reducing reliance on JavaScript-heavy frameworks.  - Educating clients on sustainable design practices.  - Rethinking portfolio projects with ethical design in mind. > "Design is the body language of a product." > — Stephen Gates ---------- The Importance of Alternative Schools of Design</p>

      <p>Traditional design education often prioritizes aesthetic refinement over ethical consideration. But alternative design schools and philosophies—such as speculative design, regenerative design, and permacomputing—offer ways to challenge corporate-driven digital experiences. Alternative Design Perspectives That Influence This Work</p>

      <p>1. Regenerative Design  - Focuses on designing systems that restore and replenish natural ecosystems rather than extract from them. 2. Permacomputing  - A low-tech approach that promotes energy efficiency, local-first software, and longevity over innovation-for-innovation’s-sake. 3. Brutalist Web Design  - Rejects overly-polished, consumerist digital aesthetics in favor of raw, utilitarian layouts that prioritize function over form. 4. Speculative & Critical Design  - Challenges the idea that tech always equals progress, instead encouraging designers to ask: Should this even exist? > "What if, instead of designing for convenience, we designed for consciousness?" > — Dunne & Raby, Speculative Everything</p>

      <p>Alternative design schools remind us that design is not neutral. Every decision, from color choices to UX flow, either contributes to or challenges the status quo.</p>

      <p>---------- Pixels and Principles</p>

      <p>(A poem on ethical design) We push the pixels, adjust the grid, Align the elements, keep them hid. A thousand screens, a million taps, Trapped in loops of endless maps. The brief says "frictionless, sleek, and fast," But what if slow is built to last? We A/B test and optimize, Yet miss the world beyond our eyes. The CTA glows, the clicks increase, But does it bring the world to peace? A like, a share, a fleeting view— What does our interface really do? Not every problem needs a swipe, Not every form should auto-type. Let’s break the frame, step back in time, And ask: Is design always the right design?</p>

      <p>Pixels Are Not the Revolution (after Diane di Prima) This is a warning. they will tell you frictionless like it’s a hymn, like it’s salvation— but what if the cracks are where the light gets in? Swipe, tap, optimize— as if a world could be saved in the space of a pixel. as if a button could replace the burning need to touch, to hunger, to fight. every night they whisper scale, scale, scale but no one asks why. no one stops to see what the algorithm erases what the perfect flowchart leaves behind. this is a refusal. let the page load slow if it must— let it make you think. not every door should open with a click. not every question needs an answer right now.</p>

      <p>---------- Conclusion: The Future of Ethical Digital Design</p>

      <p>This project is a call to action. The DeepMay.net redesign is not just about aesthetics—it’s about proving that front-end decisions impact sustainability. The campfire talk reinforces the privilege of design: every button we place, every animation we introduce, and every extra line of code has consequences. By advocating for design that serves, not manipulates, we reclaim the integrity of our craft and challenge the industry to do better.</p>
