      <h1>Raids Case Study: Enhancing Twitch’s Raid Feature to Support Content Creator Success Author: Senior Product Designer, Streamer Success Team</h1>

      <p>Introduction Twitch’s Raid feature allows content creators to redirect their live audience to another channel at the end of a broadcast, fostering community engagement and helping viewers discover new content. However, creators have faced challenges in selecting appropriate raid targets, often relying on manual searches or personal networks. To address this, Twitch implemented enhancements to the Raid feature, aiming to streamline the process and support content creator growth. As Emmett Shear, Twitch’s co-founder, once stated:</p>

      <blockquote> Twitch is about bringing people together every day. The Raid feature is a core part of how we empower creators to build and support each other’s communities.</blockquote>

      <p>Twitch’s Mission and Goals Twitch’s mission is to "create belonging by enabling content creators to build community." This mission emphasizes the platform’s commitment to fostering connections among creators and their audiences, cultivating interactive and engaging communities. A successful content creator on Twitch is typically measured by:</p>

      <h5>Community Engagement</h5>
      <p>Active participation from viewers through chat, subscriptions, and other forms of support</p>
      <h5>Follower Growth</h5>
      <p>A steady increase in followers, indicating rising popularity and reach.</p>
      <h5>Consistency and Quality</h5>
      <p>Regular streaming schedules and high-quality content that resonates with the audience.</p>
      <h5>Monetization & Retention</h5>
      <p>Increasing revenue streams via subscriptions, bits, sponsorships, and ad revenue while maintaining viewer retention.</p>

      <p>To support content creators in achieving these milestones, Twitch offers resources like the Creator Camp and Partner Program, which provide guidance on best practices and growth strategies.</p>

      <h2>Problem Statement Despite the popularity of raids, content creators encountered several pain points:</h2>

      <h5>1. Difficulty Finding Relevant Raid Targets</h5> 
      <p>Creators spent excessive time manually searching for appropriate channels, often relying on personal relationships rather than data-driven insights. A mid-tier Twitch partner said in a user interview:</p> 
      <blockquote>I want to support smaller streamers, but it takes too long to find the right one</blockquote>
      <h5>2. Low Viewer Retention Post-Raid</h5>
      <p>Many raids resulted in significant viewer drop-off shortly after transitioning to the new channel. According to engagement reports:</p>
      <blockquote>45% of raided viewers leave within the first five minutes</blockquote>
      <h5>3. Limited Raid Personalization</h5>
      <p>The existing system lacked filtering options to help creators choose relevant raid targets aligned with their audience’s interests. In a feedback survey a streamer reported:</p>
      <blockquote>I'd love to raid people who play similar games to me, but the current system doesn’t help with that</blockquote> 
      <h5>4. Potential for Harassment</h5>
      <p>Some creators experienced disruptive behavior from unsolicited raids. A Twitch Affiliate shared:</p>
      <blockquote>I had a hate raid once, and it took my mods 20 minutes to control it</blockquote>

      <h2>Design Thinking Process To enhance the Raid feature, Twitch’s product design team followed a structured Design Thinking approach:</h2>

      <h3>1. Empathize</h3>
      <h5>User Interviews</h5> 
      <p>The team conducted in-depth interviews with over 150 content creators to gain insights into their raiding experiences, challenges, and desires. - Visual Suggestion: A collage of interview snapshots or a word cloud highlighting common pain points and desires expressed by creators.</p>
      <h5>Engagement Metrics Analysis</h5> 
      <p>By examining data such as viewer drop-off rates post-raid, the team identified patterns indicating low retention. - Visual Suggestion: Graphs depicting viewer retention rates before and after raids, emphasizing significant drop-offs.</p>
      <h5>Community Feedback Review</h5> 
      <p>The team analyzed feedback from forums, social media, and support tickets to understand negative raid experiences, including harassment issues. - Visual Suggestion: Screenshots of community discussions or a thematic map categorizing types of feedback received.</p>

      <h3>2. Define</h3>

      <h5>Problem Statements</h5>

      <h3>3. Ideate</h3>

      <h5>Brainstorming Sessions</h5>
      <p>The team explored various solutions such as personalized raid recommendations, advanced filtering options, and enhanced moderation tools. - Visual Suggestion: Photographs of brainstorming sessions with sticky notes on a whiteboard, capturing the flow of ideas.</p>
      <h5>Machine Learning Models</h5>
      <p>They considered employing algorithms to analyze content similarity and viewer behavior, aiming to suggest relevant raid targets. - Visual Suggestion: Diagrams illustrating how machine learning models match streamers based on content and audience overlap.</p>

      <h3>4. Prototype</h3>

      <h5>Feature Development</h5>
      <p>The team created prototypes for a Raid Quick-Action Button and Advanced Filtering Options, integrating real-time data to assist creators in selecting raid targets. - Visual Suggestion: Screenshots or wireframes of the prototype interfaces, demonstrating the new raid selection features.</p>

      <blockquote>Hate raids have been a big issue. This is a game-changer for small streamers.</blockquote>
      <h5>4. Data-Driven Raid Insights</h5>
      <p>Implemented post-raid analytics, showing viewer retention, engagement metrics, and new follower conversion rates. Creators using these insights adjusted raid strategies, leading to a 20% increase in new follower retention.A Twitch Affiliate shared:</p>
      <blockquote>I love seeing how many people stick around after a raid, it helps me refine my approach!</blockquote>
