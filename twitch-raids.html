      <p>Raids Case Study: Enhancing Twitch’s Raid Feature to Support Content Creator Success Author: Senior Product Designer, Streamer Success Team</p>

      <p>----------</p>

      <p>Introduction Twitch’s Raid feature allows content creators to redirect their live audience to another channel at the end of a broadcast, fostering community engagement and helping viewers discover new content. However, creators have faced challenges in selecting appropriate raid targets, often relying on manual searches or personal networks. To address this, Twitch implemented enhancements to the Raid feature, aiming to streamline the process and support content creator growth. As Emmett Shear, Twitch’s co-founder, once stated:</p>

      <p>> "Twitch is about bringing people together every day. The Raid feature is a core part of how we empower creators to build and support each other’s communities."</p>

      <p>Twitch’s Mission and Goals Twitch’s mission is to "create belonging by enabling content creators to build community." This mission emphasizes the platform’s commitment to fostering connections among creators and their audiences, cultivating interactive and engaging communities. A successful content creator on Twitch is typically measured by:</p>

      <p>- Community Engagement: Active participation from viewers through chat, subscriptions, and other forms of support. - Follower Growth: A steady increase in followers, indicating rising popularity and reach. - Consistency and Quality: Regular streaming schedules and high-quality content that resonates with the audience. - Monetization & Retention: Increasing revenue streams via subscriptions, bits, sponsorships, and ad revenue while maintaining viewer retention.</p>

      <p>To support content creators in achieving these milestones, Twitch offers resources like the Creator Camp and Partner Program, which provide guidance on best practices and growth strategies.</p>

      <p>----------</p>

      <p>Problem Statement Despite the popularity of raids, content creators encountered several pain points:</p>

      <p>1. Difficulty Finding Relevant Raid Targets: Creators spent excessive time manually searching for appropriate channels, often relying on personal relationships rather than data-driven insights.  - "I want to support smaller streamers, but it takes too long to find the right one," said a mid-tier Twitch partner in a user interview. 2. Low Viewer Retention Post-Raid: Many raids resulted in significant viewer drop-off shortly after transitioning to the new channel.  - According to engagement reports, "45% of raided viewers leave within the first five minutes." 3. Limited Raid Personalization: The existing system lacked filtering options to help creators choose relevant raid targets aligned with their audience’s interests.  - "I'd love to raid people who play similar games to me, but the current system doesn’t help with that," reported a streamer in a feedback survey. 4. Potential for Harassment: Some creators experienced disruptive behavior from unsolicited raids.  - "I had a hate raid once, and it took my mods 20 minutes to control it," shared a Twitch Affiliate. ----------</p>

      <p>Design Thinking Process To enhance the Raid feature, Twitch’s product design team followed a structured Design Thinking approach:</p>

      <p>1. Empathize</p>

      <p>- User Interviews: The team conducted in-depth interviews with over 150 content creators to gain insights into their raiding experiences, challenges, and desires. - Visual Suggestion: A collage of interview snapshots or a word cloud highlighting common pain points and desires expressed by creators. - Engagement Metrics Analysis: By examining data such as viewer drop-off rates post-raid, the team identified patterns indicating low retention. - Visual Suggestion: Graphs depicting viewer retention rates before and after raids, emphasizing significant drop-offs. - Community Feedback Review: The team analyzed feedback from forums, social media, and support tickets to understand negative raid experiences, including harassment issues. - Visual Suggestion: Screenshots of community discussions or a thematic map categorizing types of feedback received.</p>

      <p>2. Define</p>

      <p>- Problem Statements: The team synthesized findings to articulate core issues:  - Difficulty in selecting appropriate raid targets.  - Low viewer retention post-raid.  - Lack of personalization in raid options.  - Exposure to potential harassment through raids. - Visual Suggestion: A flowchart illustrating the current raid process, highlighting pain points at each stage. - Success Metrics: The team established clear objectives, including increasing raid frequency, improving viewer retention, and enhancing creator satisfaction. - Visual Suggestion: A dashboard mock-up showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to raids.</p>

      <p>3. Ideate</p>

      <p>- Brainstorming Sessions: The team explored various solutions such as personalized raid recommendations, advanced filtering options, and enhanced moderation tools. - Visual Suggestion: Photographs of brainstorming sessions with sticky notes on a whiteboard, capturing the flow of ideas. - Machine Learning Models: They considered employing algorithms to analyze content similarity and viewer behavior, aiming to suggest relevant raid targets. - Visual Suggestion: Diagrams illustrating how machine learning models match streamers based on content and audience overlap.</p>

      <p>4. Prototype</p>

      <p>- Feature Development: The team created prototypes for a Raid Quick-Action Button and Advanced Filtering Options, integrating real-time data to assist creators in selecting raid targets. - Visual Suggestion: Screenshots or wireframes of the prototype interfaces, demonstrating the new raid selection features. - User Testing: A select group of content creators interacted with these prototypes, providing feedback on usability and effectiveness. - Visual Suggestion: Images of creators testing the new features, accompanied by feedback annotations.</p>

      <p>5. Test</p>

      <p>- Beta Launch: The team rolled out the enhanced features to 500 content creators, collecting both qualitative feedback and quantitative data. - Visual Suggestion: A timeline graphic showing the beta testing phase, including participant demographics and duration. - Data Analysis: They assessed metrics such as raid frequency, viewer retention, and incident reports to evaluate the impact of the new features. - Visual Suggestion: Before-and-after bar charts comparing key metrics like viewer retention rates and raid frequencies. ----------</p>

      <p>Implemented Features After testing and iteration, the following improvements were rolled out:</p>

      <p>1. Raid Quick-Action Button  - Provides real-time suggestions for potential raid targets based on factors like viewer overlap, content type, and past raid interactions.  - Reduced the average raid selection time from 90 seconds to 30 seconds, streamlining the process.  - "This makes raiding so much easier! I can focus on saying goodbye to my community instead of scrambling to find someone," shared a Twitch Partner. 2. Advanced Filtering Options  - Allows creators to filter potential raid targets by viewer count, stream duration, content category, language, and past collaborations.  - Increased the likelihood of relevant raids, leading to a 15% rise in viewer retention post-raid.  - "Now I can find someone in my niche without manually scrolling through channels," a beta tester commented. 3. Safety and Moderation Enhancements  - Introduced Raid Controls, enabling creators to restrict raids to followers, mutuals, or approved lists.  - Added Moderation Tools to detect and mitigate potential raid-based harassment.  - Led to a 30% decrease in negative raid reports.  - "Hate raids have been a big issue. This is a game-changer for small streamers," noted a partnered creator. 4. Data-Driven Raid Insights  - Implemented post-raid analytics, showing viewer retention, engagement metrics, and new follower conversion rates.  - Creators using these insights adjusted raid strategies, leading to a 20% increase in new follower retention.  - "I love seeing how many people stick around after a raid—it helps me refine my approach!" shared a Twitch Affiliate. ----------</p>

      <p>Testing and Results During the beta phase, Twitch observed notable improvements in key metrics:</p>

      <p>- Increased Raid Engagement: Content creators utilizing the new features reported a 20% increase in raid frequency. - Higher Viewer Retention: Channels raided through the enhanced system experienced a 15% increase in viewer retention during the first 10 minutes post-raid. - Greater Creator Satisfaction: Feedback surveys indicated that 85% of participating content creators felt more confident in their raid choices due to improved recommendations and filtering options.</p>

      <p>----------</p>

      <p>Alignment with Twitch’s Goals These enhancements directly support Twitch’s mission and goals:</p>

      <p>- Strengthening Community Bonds: By making raiding easier and more effective, content creators can connect their communities with others, fostering a sense of belonging and mutual support. - Facilitating Growth: Improved raid functionalities enable content creators to reach new audiences, promoting follower growth and increased engagement. - Enhancing Content Discovery: With personalized raid suggestions and filtering options, viewers are introduced to content that aligns with their interests, enriching their platform experience. - Improving Safety & Retention: By implementing moderation tools and raid controls, Twitch mitigates negative experiences and fosters a more positive environment for creators. ----------</p>

      <p>Conclusion By applying design thinking principles and incorporating direct feedback from the creator community, Twitch successfully enhanced the Raid feature to better serve content creators’ needs. These improvements not only streamlined the raid selection process but also contributed to increased community engagement and content creator satisfaction, aligning with Twitch’s broader mission of building an interconnected and thriving platform. Through continuous iteration and data-driven refinements, Twitch remains committed to empowering content creators, fostering community engagement, and enhancing discoverability—all of which are essential for long-term platform success.</p>
