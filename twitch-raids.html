      <h1>Twitch’s Raids and Content Creator Success</h1>
      <span>My Role: Senior Product Designer, Streamer Success Team</span>

      <p>Twitch’s Raid feature allows content creators to redirect their live audience to another channel at the end of a broadcast, fostering community engagement and helping viewers discover new content. However, creators were facing challenges in selecting appropriate raid targets, often relying on manual searches or personal networks. To address this, we implemented enhancements to the Raid feature, aiming to streamline the process and support content creator growth. As Emmett Shear, Twitch’s co-founder, once stated:</p>

      <blockquote> Twitch is about bringing people together every day. The Raid feature is a core part of how we empower creators to build and support each other’s communities.</blockquote>

      <p>Twitch’s mission is to "create belonging by enabling content creators to build community." This mission emphasizes the platform’s commitment to fostering connections among creators and their audiences, cultivating interactive and engaging communities. A successful content creator on Twitch is typically measured by:</p>

      <h5>Community Engagement</h5>
      <p>Active participation from viewers through chat, subscriptions, and other forms of support</p>
      <h5>Follower Growth</h5>
      <p>A steady increase in followers, indicating rising popularity and reach</p>
      <h5>Consistency and Quality</h5>
      <p>Regular streaming schedules and high-quality content that resonates with the audience</p>
      <h5>Monetization & Retention</h5>
      <p>Increasing revenue streams via subscriptions, bits, sponsorships, and ad revenue while maintaining viewer retention</p>

      <h2>But despite the popularity of Raids, content creators encountered several pain points:</h2>
      <h5>1. Difficulty Finding Relevant Raid Targets</h5> 
      <p>Creators spent excessive time manually searching for appropriate channels, often relying on personal relationships rather than data-driven insights. A mid-tier Twitch partner said in an user interview:</p> 
      <blockquote>I want to support smaller streamers, but it takes too long to find the right one</blockquote>
      <h5>2. Low Viewer Retention Post-Raid</h5>
      <p>Many Raids resulted in significant viewer drop-off shortly after transitioning to the new channel. According to engagement reports:</p>
      <blockquote>45% of Raided viewers leave within the first five minutes</blockquote>
      <h5>3. Limited Raid Personalization</h5>
      <p>The existing system lacked filtering options to help creators choose relevant raid targets aligned with their audience’s interests. In a feedback survey a streamer reported:</p>
      <blockquote>I'd love to raid people who play similar games to me, but the current system doesn’t help with that</blockquote> 
      <h5>4. Potential for Harassment</h5>
      <p>Some creators experienced disruptive behavior from unsolicited raids. A Twitch Affiliate shared:</p>
      <blockquote>I had a hate raid once, and it took my mods 20 minutes to control it</blockquote>

      <h2>To enhance the Raid feature, we followed a structured Design Thinking approach:</h2>

      <h3>1. Empathize</h3>
      <h5>User Interviews</h5> 
      <p>The team conducted in-depth interviews with over 150 content creators to gain insights into their Raiding experiences, challenges, and desires.</p>
      <h5>Engagement Metrics Analysis</h5> 
      <p>By examining data such as viewer drop-off rates post-raid, the team identified patterns indicating low retention.</p>
      <img src="imgs/raids-retention-graph.jpg">
      <h5>Community Feedback Review</h5> 
      <p>The team analyzed feedback from forums, social media, and support tickets to understand negative Raid experiences, including harassment issues.</p>

      <h3>2. Define</h3>

      <h5>Problem Statements</h5>
      <p>The team synthesized findings to articulate core issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Difficulty in selecting appropriate raid targets</li>
        <li>Low viewer retention post-raid</li>
        <li>Lack of personalization in Raid options</li> 
        <li>Exposure to potential harassment through Raids</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Success Metrics</h5> 
      <p>The team established clear objectives, including increasing raid frequency, improving viewer retention, and enhancing creator satisfaction.</p>

      <h3>3. Ideate</h3>

      <h5>Brainstorming Sessions</h5>
      <p>The team explored various solutions such as personalized Raid recommendations, advanced filtering options, and enhanced moderation tools.</p>
      <img src="imgs/raid-whiteboard.jpg">
      <h5>Machine Learning Models</h5>
      <p>We considered employing algorithms to analyze content similarity and viewer behavior, aiming to suggest relevant Raid targets.</p>

      <h3>4. Prototype</h3>

      <h5>Feature Development</h5>
      <p>The team created prototypes for a Raid Quick Action button and advanced filtering options, integrating real-time data to assist creators in selecting Raid targets.</p>

      <h5>User Testing</h5>
      <p>A select group of content creators interacted with these prototypes, providing feedback on usability and effectiveness.</p>

      <h3>5. Test</h3>

      <h5>Beta Launch</h5>
      <p>The team rolled out the enhanced features to 500 content creators, collecting both qualitative feedback and quantitative data.</p>
      <h5>Data Analysis</h5>
      <p>They assessed metrics such as Raid frequency, viewer retention, and incident reports to evaluate the impact of the new features.</p>

      <div class="caption">A video done by a content creator showcasing the new Raid enhancements</div>
      <h5>1. Raid Quick Action Button</h5>
      <p>Provides real-time suggestions for potential Raid targets based on factors like viewer overlap, content type, and past Raid interactions. Reduced the average Raid selection time from 90 seconds to 30 seconds, streamlining the process. A Twitch Partner shared:<p>
      <blockquote>This makes Raiding so much easier! I can focus on saying goodbye to my community instead of scrambling to find someone.</blockquote>
      <h5>2. Advanced Filtering Options</h5>
      <p>Allows creators to filter potential Raid targets by viewer count, stream duration, content category, language, and past collaborations. Increased the likelihood of relevant Raids, leading to a 15% rise in viewer retention post-raid. A beta tester commented:</p>
      <blockquote>Now I can find someone in my niche without manually scrolling through channels</blockquote>
      <h5>3. Safety and Moderation Enhancements</h5>
      <p>Introduced Raid Controls, enabling creators to restrict Raids to followers, mutuals, or approved lists. Added moderation tools to detect and mitigate potential raid-based harassment. Led to a 30% decrease in negative Raid reports. A partnered creator noted</p>
      <blockquote>Hate Raids have been a big issue. This is a game-changer for small streamers.</blockquote>
      <h5>4. Data-Driven Raid Insights</h5>
      <p>Implemented post-raid analytics, showing viewer retention, engagement metrics, and new follower conversion rates. Creators using these insights adjusted Raid strategies, leading to a 20% increase in new follower retention. A Twitch Affiliate shared:</p>
      <blockquote>I love seeing how many people stick around after a raid, it helps me refine my approach!</blockquote>
      <img src="imgs/raids-enhancements-graph.jpg">
