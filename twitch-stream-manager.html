      <h1>Redesigning the Twitch Dashboard</h1>
      <span>My Role: Senior Product Designer, Streamer Success Team</span>
      <p><em>"Less interface. More creator success."</em></p>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Dashboard is the command center for Twitch creators but it was becoming a cockpit of buttons, tabs, and metrics that too often distracted from the real task: going live and connecting with your audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I joined the project, only 34% of users who showed streaming intent actually streamed within 90 days. Of those, just 3% became part-time or full-time streamers. That’s not a design problem that’s a focus problem.
      </p>
      <p><strong>So we asked:</strong><br />What could we do to help creators focus on what they love doing?</p>
      <h2>Users</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>primary customer</strong> is the creator. Specifically, new and small creators that are looking to understand all of the different elements that go into successfully streaming on Twitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>secondary customer</strong> is existing and established creators that have a grasp on the current complexity of successfully streaming on Twitch but need help understanding and interacting with new features and functionality that Twitch develops.
      </p>
      <h2>Design Goals</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Show less. Guide more.</strong>
          <blockquote>Replace dashboards with decisions.</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Let data drive the experience.</strong>
          <blockquote>Don’t make users hunt. Bring actions forward when they matter.</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adapt complexity gradually.</strong>
          <blockquote>New creators shouldn’t see the same controls as pros on day one.</blockquote>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>User Testing & Prototype Validation</h2>
      <p>
        Before final implementation, we tested an interactive prototype with a mix of new and experienced streamers. Participants were given common streaming tasks to complete without guidance.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Our goal:</strong> validate clarity, discoverability, and ease-of-use across the redesigned layout.

      <h3>Tasks Included:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you update your stream title?</li>
        <li>Can you post an update to Twitter or Facebook?</li>
        <li>Can you remove the <em>Raid Channel</em> quick action?</li>
        <li>Can you add a quick action for <em>Squad Streaming</em>?</li>
        <li>Can you tell how many viewers and followers you have right now?</li>
        <li>Can you add a stat to the top bar for <em>Subscribers</em>?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Users completed all key tasks with minimal friction. Key themes emerged:

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customization was intuitive</strong> – 6/6 participants customized quick actions without asking how.</li>
        <li><strong>Status and stats were discoverable</strong> – Viewer/follower count and stream health were found quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge cases were handled</strong> – Even lower-frequency actions like social sharing were successfully completed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The new layout helped users feel confident, in control, and focused without needing instructions.</p>

      <h2>Key Features & Principles</h2>
      <h3>Twitch Default Blueprint</h3>
      <video width="100%" height="386" controls>
        <source src="imgs/stream-manager-wip.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
      <div class="caption">"Working" prototype of Stream Manager built by myself with JSON filler data and React</div>
      <p>We built a data backed blueprint for success:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Auto-suggested Quick Actions</li>
        <li>Recommended tags and stream categories</li>
        <li>Timely prompts (e.g. “Run 30s Ad” only during peak moments)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <img class="image--big" src="imgs/responsive-stream-manager.png">
    <div class="image--caption">Mock of the responsive drag and drop resizing UI system</div>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Creators could still customize but they weren’t starting from zero.</strong></p>
      <h3>Contextual Simplicity</h3>
      <p>We minimized clutter by showing only what matters right now:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Just went live? Show chat, title, and stream health.</li>
        <li>Getting followers? Highlight engagement stats.</li>
        <li>Stream ending? Show clip/export tools.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Quick Actions Framework</h3>
      <p>
        Quick Actions were redesigned as modular, editable tiles, visually clear, color-coded, and flexible.
      </p>
      <img src="imgs/quick-action.png">
      <blockquote>
        “…the Quick Action colors contrast so well against the dark background and are visually appealing.” – User tester
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Outcomes:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced number of clicks by 40%</li>
        <li>Increased action discoverability in usability tests (6/6 participants passed all key tasks)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Stream Activity Feed</h3>
      <p>
        We cleaned up the Activity Feed and brought it closer to the core streaming tools (chat, preview, and stream health), minimizing context switching.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “This tool offers you anything you would need to monitor, edit, or change your stream.” – Participant feedback
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Mobile Adaptation</h3>
      <img src="imgs/stream-manager-mobile.png">
      <p>The mobile version prioritized:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Live chat + preview first</li>
        <li>Stream stats in a collapsible drawer</li>
        <li>Same quick actions in tap friendly format</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This way, a mobile stream didn’t feel like a stripped down experience; it felt intentional.
      </p>

      <h2>Lessons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Less interface = more confidence</strong><br />
        New creators were overwhelmed by too many tools. Reducing what we showed built clarity and momentum.</li>
        <li><strong>Good defaults are invisible help</strong><br />
        A Twitch-guided layout helped creators skip configuration and focus on streaming.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization is good. Guided customization is better.</strong><br />
        People don’t want to build a dashboard, they want to go live.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Stream Manager redesign wasn’t about packing in more controls. It was about getting out of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        By designing around actions, not apps, and guidance, not GUIs, we helped creators succeed faster, with fewer buttons, fewer doubts, and more joy.
