      <h1>Breaking the Algorithm, My Amazon Experience & Climate Justice</h1>
      <p>While working at Twitch, an Amazon owned company, I became actively involved with 
      Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ), a collective of workers demanding stronger 
      environmental policies across Amazonâ€™s vast operations. From my position in tech, I saw how Amazonâ€™s business 
      decisions werenâ€™t just about innovation or efficiencyâ€”they had real consequences for the planet and for people 
      in frontline communities.</p>

      <p>In September 2019, I joined thousands of Amazon employees in a walkout to protest the companyâ€™s environmental 
      policies. We knew that for all of Amazonâ€™s sustainability rhetoric, it remained one of the worldâ€™s largest 
      corporate polluters.</p>

      <blockquote>Amazon employees are deeply concerned about the climate crisis, and we see how it's impacting our lives.
      <em> âˆ¼ myself, Business Insider, Inc, One Green Planet</em></blockquote>

      <p>That pressure worked. Shortly after, Amazon announced The Climate Pledge, committing to 
      net-zero carbon emissions by 2040; 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The company promised to transition to 
      100% renewable energy by 2025 and to purchase 100,000 electric delivery vehicles. But those of us in AECJ knew 
      that pledges alone werenâ€™t enough. A company that profits from fossil fuel contracts and operates a supply chain 
      that disproportionately harms low income communities cannot simply buy its way into sustainability.</p>

      <img src="imgs/scamazon-3.jpg">

      <p>In January 2020, Amazonâ€™s legal and HR departments sent warnings to me and my fellow AECJ organizers, telling 
      us to stop speaking out. But I refused to be silent.</p>

      <blockquote>Throughout history, change has happened only after brave people spoke out, even when at risk to themselves.<em>âˆ¼ myself, Geek Wire, Wired</em></blockquote>

      <p>I understood the risks, but I also knew that change never comes without resistance.</p>

      <p>Working at Twitch gave me a unique perspective within Amazon. While my job in tech insulated me from some of 
      the companyâ€™s harsher labor conditions, I saw how Amazonâ€™s warehouse workers, who make Amazonâ€™s fast delivery 
      ecosystem possible, were being exploited. Many of them worked in extreme heat, under relentless quotas, and with little 
      job security. It was clear to me that Amazonâ€™s environmental and labor issues were deeply connected.</p>

      <blockquote>You cannot buy the revolution. You cannot make the revolution. You can only be the revolution. It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere.<em>âˆ¼ Diane di Prima</em></blockquote>

      <p>I took that to heart. If Amazon was going to change, it wouldnâ€™t be because of corporate pledges or shareholder decisions alone. It would be because workers across all levels, from warehouses to tech offices, demanded it.</p>

      <img src="imgs/scamazon-2.jpg">

      <p>Thatâ€™s why I used my position to amplify the voices of frontline communities suffering from Amazonâ€™s pollution 
      and warehouse expansion. Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities are the ones 
      breathing in the diesel fumes from Amazonâ€™s supply chain while executives celebrate their sustainability goals. 
      AECJ fought to expose these injustices and push for real accountability.</p>

      <blockquote>No one way works, it will take all of us shoving at the thing from all sides to bring it down.<em>âˆ¼ Diane di Prima, Revolutionary Letter #8</em></blockquote>

      <p>Thatâ€™s how I approached this fight. At Twitch, I spoke out against Amazonâ€™s environmental harm and the way it 
      treated its workers. I used my voice alongside warehouse employees, climate activists, and fellow tech workers 
      to demand real change.</p>

      <p>Amazon tried to silence us, but I refuse to accept business as usual.</p>

      <blockquote>The war that matters is the war against the imagination. All other wars are subsumed in it.<em>âˆ¼ Diane di Prima</em></blockquote>

      <p>I still refuse to let Amazon define what is possible. A better future exists, not in corporate statements, but in the 
      voices of those who continue to push for justice. We will not stop.</p>
